Each lines has a struct corresponding to it.
The input_cmd is a list of those structs.

A chained list of cmd_line structs. Doubly linked (move up and down);
Data we need :
	window size;
	starting position
	char *cmd_line
	nb_lines;

When writing on a cmd_line : normal rules, except when printing a
newline(position == ws->columns)
nb_lines = ft_strlen(cmd_line) / ws->columns
current_cursor_pos.row = cmd_line.start.row + (pointer_pos / ws->columns)
current_cursor_pos.columns = pointer_pos % ws->columns;
case where start pos is before terminal (negative)
