open in RD_ONLY the history file, located in ~/.21shhistory
if there's an error, display an error msg, chained list will be NULL

read the file and fill the corresponding doubly history linked_list with txt and number (each newline)

when pressing up arrow, get linked_list->prev
if linked_list->prev == NULL -> BELL
else, switch fill_cmd_struct with this line (function switch_cmd_struct)

when pressing down arrow, same as up but with get linked_list->next

each time we call handle_input, append the cmd_struct.

if  we get to HIST_SIZE + MAX_SIZE, free the first MAX_SIZE - HIST_SIZE nodes;
on exit:
open hist_file in O_CREATE, RD_ONLY, O_TRUNC and write the history_linked_list, up until HIST_SIZE.

on crash, do not write history (?)

history builtin that read the linked list and prints it
